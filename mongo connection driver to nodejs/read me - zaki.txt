-- Fix MongoDb Problem : just when you finished installation create a folder 'c:/data/db'

-- to connect MongoDb with NodeJS, you want to include 'node_modules' folder to your project
if already you have a the same name of 'node_modules', just copy the conataint into 1er foler.

if you have any problem just put this command ' npm install mongodb ' to current project folder

thank you zaki ^^
